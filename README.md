# Music Theory quiz
**This is a portfolio project for an online programming course**  
**I am using this project to practice using git and github**
## Description
This python terminal quiz will test your knowledge on various music theory concepts and music history.  
The code will ask 15 (May increase in the future) random questions from a pool of many. More questions will come in the future.  
~~It will display your final score an the end of the quiz~~  
#### Why a music quiz?  
 I chose to do a music based project for this because I am a musician and I enjoy playing instruments very much. If we had  
more time I would love to learn as many instruments as I could, but work ðŸ™„
